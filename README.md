# Marine-Plastic-Pollution
## Forecasting of global plastic production and analysis of the factors responsible for ocean pollution.
### Abstarct
The amount of plastic enters the ocean is doubling every year. Factors that are mainly responsible for this increasing rate are still unknown or ignored. With the help of comprehensive data on different plastics disposal methods, the rate of plastic waste, coastal populations, and plastic production rate, we are trying to estimate factors that are responsible for polluting the earth’s environment. Plastic Production is a vital element of this environmental problem; Its global production rate reached 359 Million metric tons in the year 2018. If waste management techniques are not improved or taken seriously, marine life will be in the most significant trouble. With the help of different forecasting techniques, we are going to find out the global plastic production rate for upcoming years, hoping it will help us identify potential environmental problems.
###  Time Series Forecasting Methods

#### 1. Average or Mean method of forecasting: 
The average method is used for both cross-sectional and Time Series data. In average values, forecast values are equal to mean of the historical values. We will use meanf(y,h) function to find out the forecast.

y – Represents data

h – Represents forecast horizon

#### 2. Naïve Method of forecasting: 
This method is only applicable for time series data.
We will use Naïve(y,h) function for forecasting plastic production using the naïve method.

#### 3. Drift Method: 
It allows forecast to increase or decrease over time using a drift.

#### 4. Double Exponential Smoothing (Holt’s linear trend method):

Simple exponential smoothing does not support data with a trend or seasonality. Holt's method is an extension to simple exponential smoothing, which adds support for the trend component. This method is creating reliable forecasts quickly. As our data has a healthy trend pattern, we will go ahead and try to fit a double exponential smoothing method. Holt’s linear trend method has three equations, a forecast equation and two smoothing equations (for level and trend)

Forecast equation y^t+h|t=ℓt+hbt

Level equation ℓt=αyt+(1−α)(ℓt−1+bt−1)

Trend equation bt=β∗(ℓt−ℓt−1)+(1−β∗)bt−1,

Here, 

ℓt = Estimate of the level of time series 

bt = Estimate of the trend of a series 

α = Smoothing parameter for a 

level = Smoothing parameter for a trend


#### 4. Holt’s damped method:
In this method of forecasting additional parameter is added into the holt's linear method called a damping parameter. This method is appropriate for long-run forecasts. As damping parameter dampens, trend pattern forecast will remain constant for the long-run forecast.

Forecast equation ˆyt+h|t=ℓt+(ϕ+ϕ2+⋯+ϕh)bt 

Level equation ℓt=αyt+(1−α)(ℓt−1+ϕbt−1) 

Trend equation bt=β∗(ℓt−ℓt−1)+(1−β∗)ϕbt−1

Φ = Damping Parameter.

#### Result from above forecasting methods:
According to all the accuracy measures, Holt’s Linear Trend method seems more accurate. MAPE for Holt's linear trend model is 4.58, which implies a 4% error in the prediction. The damping parameter ϕ is 0.98. If the damping parameter is less than 0.80, it indicates damping has a powerful effect on the model. If ϕ is equal to 1, then we can say it is identical to Holt's linear trend model with no distinguishable result.

### Insights from Tableau Dashboards

1) Plastic Production rate is rising at an exponential rate. In just 15 years, the rate of plastic production doubled. If the same continues, we will be facing its consequences, and our environment might be at risk.

2) Plastic waste management of Upper Middle Income (UMI) and Lower Middle Income (LMI) counties is significantly weak.

3) Countries that are most responsible for producing more plastic waste to oceans are – China, Indonesia, Philippines, Vietnam, with a high coastal population, and high mismanaged plastic waste rate.

4) Yangtze river carrying the most significant amount of plastic waste, which is around 333 thousand tons, is the longest river in Asia and the third-largest in the world. Yangtze river alone carries 23.71 % of total plastic waste.

5) Maximum plastic waste in the ocean is coming from Asia. It is plastic waste input rate in percent is 86.13%

6) Covid-19 Pandemic might change the statistics in the coming months, but it is uncertain as we lack proper evidence (Data).
